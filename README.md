This repository will contain all code relevant to the set-up of my Phase One Surveys and Experiments for my MSc Research Project.

I will use the data obtained from these to test alternative survey designs (spatial layout, and temporal recording structure) when using AudioMoth recording devices to ID bird species. I will conduct these in both a mixed woodland site, and a heather moorland site in Edinburgh, Scotland.


Once conducted, details of the surveys will be available below:
